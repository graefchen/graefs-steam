A bad [fresh](https://fresh.deno.dev) Application to test some things out with
the [stapil](https://github.com/graefchen/stapil) deno library.

### Usage

Make sure to install Deno: https://deno.land/manual/getting_started/installation

Then start the project:

```
deno task start
```

This will watch the project directory and restart as necessary.
